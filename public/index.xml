      <description>A workaround to get rid of x11/compositor crash in KDE 5.x for Intel HD GPUs
 OpenGL-Compositor crash fix on wakeup/unlock event This is a simple workaround to recover from the kde compositor crashes that renders the screen with black artifacts with non-responding UI.
The idea is to keep a script running in the background which capture the dbus event of lock/unlock screen to restart kwin window manager.
Restart script  restart_kwin.</description>
