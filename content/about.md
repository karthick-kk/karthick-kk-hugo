**Hi, Iâ€™m Karthick**.

I find joy in crafting innovative solutions through scripting and utilizing diverse DevOps tools.

My expertise primarily revolves around automating intricate processes using CI/CD pipelines, custom tooling, and the containerization of applications.

Presently, I'm employed as an Infrastructure Engineer at `Ericsson`, where I collaborate with developers to refine their workflows and facilitate the seamless delivery of exceptional releases.

Prior to joining Ericsson, I served as a Cloud & DevOps Automation Expert at `Corestack`, a leading Multicloud security governance platform. Before that, I honed my skills as a Unix (Solaris & Linux) Administrator at renowned firms such as `Dell`, `Mphasis (an HP company)`, `TCS`, and `IBM`.

My journey into the realm of IT began with a role as a teaching faculty member at Dr. M.G.R Education Research Institute. During this time, I empowered students to grasp the fundamentals of Unix and introductory coding, laying the foundation for their future endeavors.
