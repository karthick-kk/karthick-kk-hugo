**Hi, I’m Karthick**.

I like building new stuffs with scripts and different devops tools.

Most of my time is spent on automating complex tasks with CI/CD pipelines, custom tooling and containerization of applications.

I’m currently working with `Ericsson`, as an Infrastructure Engineer, where I help developers streamline their workflows & build more awesome and effortless releases.

Before Ericsson, I was a Cloud & DevOps Automation Expert at `Corestack` - a Multicloud security governance platform. Before that, I worked as Unix(Solaris & Linux) Administrator in various firms like `Dell`, `Mphasis (an HP company)`, `TCS` and `IBM`.

Before into IT, I was a teaching faculty at Dr.M.G.R Education Research Institute, where I helped students to get started with their Unix basics and entry level coding.
