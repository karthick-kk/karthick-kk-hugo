Experience
----------

**Ericsson Global Services [2021 - Present]:**

Role: *Senior Infrastructure Engineer*

`Performed Roles:`
- Leading the development of `MLOPS` integrated products, making sure dependencies are uplifted and security fixes are incorporated upstream.
- Overseeing Kubernetes API upgrade lifecycle maintenance.
- Creating and managing `Helm` charts for upgrades and new releases.
- Enforcing design guidelines and policies as essential elements of the development process.
- Applying backup and restoration protocols in place for Kubernetes cluster-based application services.
- Optimizing different components and services to reduce the application footprint.

`Results:`
- By switching from standalone Kubernetes clusters to k3s-based vclusters, it was possible to successfully reduce direct infrastructure expenditure by more than 75%.
- Made it easier to provision TLS certificates dynamically, which reduced pipeline lead times by 25%.
- The security posture was substantially enhanced by implementing vault-based secret management and design guideline rules within the CICD framework. 

**CoreStack [2019 - 2021]:**

Role: *Technical Lead - DevOps Automation Engineer*

`Performed Roles:`
- Worked on ideating use cases and develop proof of concepts (POCs) for sales initiatives.
- Assisted development team with deployment pipelines that elevated faster release cycles.
- Implemented AIOps solutions to automate deployments directly from Microsoft Teams.
- Orchestrated server configurations and monitoring using `CloudFormation` (CFN), `Azure Resource Manager` (ARM), and `Terraform`.
- Developed application manifests to facilitate the deployment of services on `Kubernetes` via `Argo CD`.
- Created custom tools in `Golang` and `Python` utilizing `REST APIs` for enhanced automation capabilities.
- Designed and executed deployment pipelines utilizing `Jenkins`, `GitHub Actions`, and `Ansible`.
- Integrated automated audit and validation controls into the development process using `Chef InSpec`.

`Results:`
- The cost of cloud expenditures was significantly reduced from 312 USD to 65 USD per application after a legacy application was successfully moved to a microservices architecture. This was accomplished by distributing workloads among low-spec cloud instances and containerizing the application.
- Automated cloud instance shutdown and startup processes were put in place, which led to a significant monthly decrease in compute engine cloud costs from 24800 cloud credits to 6500 credits—a decrease of more than 75%.
